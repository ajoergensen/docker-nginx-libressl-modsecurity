#  **[nginx][3]** built with **[LibreSSL][4]**

## Features

- Uses [Alpine Linux][5] as base
- PCRE with JIT enabled
- HTTP/2.0 (+NPN) support
- Async I/O using threads support
- Dynamic TLS records patch support (and configured) - From [Cloudflare][6]
- [Brotli][7] compression support (and configured)
- [ModSecurity][2], enabled but in DetectionOnly mode by default

Currently the HPACK patch from Cloudflare is not used because it does not apply cleanly against mainline.

## Usage

```docker run --rm --name nginx -v ./htdocs:/var/www -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -d ajoergensen/nginx-libressl:tag```

Available tags are `stable` and `mainline`

## Environment

- **PUID**: Change the uid of the user running nginx
- **PGID**: Change the gid of the user running nginx
- **CHOWN_WWWDIR**: Enable/disable the change of ownership of /var/www to $PUID:$PGID, defaults to TRUE. Note, if /var/www read only this variable will always be FALSE
- **WORKER_PROCESSES**: Change the value of nginx worker_processes, defaults to auto.
- **MODSEC_MODE**: Configure the ModSecurity rules engine. Values are On, Off, DetectionOnly. Default is DetectionOnly

## Other

Though not defined as a volume, I recommend mapping a folder to /etc/nginx/conf.d to store your vhost definitions.

This image works great with [docker-gen][8] and [docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion][9] (as a drop-in replacement for the nginx-proxy image)
